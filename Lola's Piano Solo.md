\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Final-Project\
# Lola's piano solo

I propose to build a capacitive touch keyboard that will play 4-6 notes and I will video my cat playing and display while I accompany her solo in class during presentation. 

## Summary

The goal of my project was to discover how I could create a musical device with my computer. I am using an Arduino Sensor shield and an Arduino Leonardo, which acts as a USB port, to connect to conductive material. The conductive material is copper and I will be creating my own keyboard that will be receptive to touch through a sample code I found on-line that has been modified to play the keyboard sounds when I touch them. The code will be modified from being a synth machine to just a simple keyboard, as well as the pitch will be altered to be a more harmonious device than the code provided on through the ada fruit site. 

The main goal is to have the device up and running and then to gently torture my old hip kat, Lola, by encouraging her (with catnip) to play the keys. The idea is to play on the pun of hip kat like a jazz musician while playing along side to a video of her, as a demonstration, during class. 
Much like jazz, the jam session will be intuitive and abstract. While I am demonstrating, a string of neopixel lights will dance along to the music.

## Component & Parts

Hardware-
-Arduino Leonardo MIDI (borrowed)\
-Arduino Sensor Shield (checked out from the hybrid lab)\
-ada fruit neopixel strip\
-video camera on my phone\
-copper plates shaped into a keyboard\
\
software-\
ada fruit capacitive touch drum machine code example  through arduino- with some changes\
arduino \
##challenges-\
I believe the challenges will be to get the pitch to sound decent so that the notes that get played do not sound random and grating. I also see a challenge being to get all of the notes to play, as the first iteration would only play the first few keys. Finally, I think getting the video of lola up and running and having it communicate the feeling that Im interested in \

## Timeline
\
What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible! \
\
- Week 1: Write proposal\
- Week 2: Acquire hardware, find good code to use, study wiring \
- Week 3: build first version of device and run first round of code- modify\
- Week 4: have second version with wider copper keys besides tape\
- Week 5: Present!\
